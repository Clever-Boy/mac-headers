Private headers collected from OSX 10.8.2 and XCode 4.5.3 based on instruction  
found in http://www.saurik.com/id/4. This is a partial collection stopped 
before the "Secruity" headers. 

See http://github.com/realthunder/mac-headers/collect.sh for details. 

To use some of the headers, you probably need PRIVATE=1 defined before 
inclusion.
